# 1. Presentation of the solution

Semantic Harmony Social Network is a peer-to-peer (p2p) social network based on user interests.

The main goal of the project is to provide a p2p system that allows users to automatically establish friendships, all through a matching strategy.

APIs have been provided that allow each user who accesses the network to:

1. Receive a series of questions that will allow matching with other users (friendship).
2. Create a profile key that will identify the user within the social network.
3. Log in to the social network.
4. Display the list of friends (automatically established).

In addition to these features, three more have also been implemented:

1. Search for a user within the social network and view their data.
2. Update your personal data (previously entered).
3. Log out of the social network.

Semantic Harmony Social Network uses a DHT that allows the storage of information relating to each individual user who accesses the social network (user data).

Some of the APIs described above had to be implemented sequentially, as the result of using one of them is the input of another.

When a user logs in to the social network, all users connected at that moment will receive a notification message. This message is sent thanks to an implementation of direct sending of messages to each user of the social network. This information is known to all connected users.



# 2. Technologies used#

- **Programming language**: Java 8
- **DHT management**: TOM P2P
- **Software Project Management**: Apache Maven
- **Containerization technology**: Docker
- **Testing**: JUnit v4.11



# 3. Structure of the project

The project is structured as follows:

- `social`
  - `src`
    - `main\java\it\unisa\adc\p2p`
      - `interfaces`
        - `MessageListener.java`
        - `SocialInterface.java`
      - `object`
        - `User.java`
      - `utility`
        - `Functions.java`
        - `Question.java`
      - `App.java`
      - `SocialImplementation.java`
    - `test\java\it\unisa\adc\p2p`
      - `AppTest.java`

1. The organization is mainly divided into 3 categories:

   1. the interfaces used in the project
   2. the classes object (pure java object)
   3. classes with utility functions



## 3.1 Description of the code

The proposed solution starts from well-defined APIs for solving the problem, described below:

```java
/*Interface provided by the teacher containing the methods to be compulsorily implemented.*/
public interface SocialInterface {

	/**
	 * Gets the social network users questions.
	 * 
	 * @return a list of String that is the profile questions.
	 */
	public List<String> getUserProfileQuestions();

	/**
	 * Creates a new user profile key according the user answers.
	 * 
	 * @param _answer a list of answers.
	 * @return a String, the obtained profile key.
	 */
	public String createAuserProfileKey(List<Integer> _answer);

	/**
	 * Joins in the Network. An automatic messages to each potential new friend is
	 * generated.
	 * 
	 * @param _profile_key a String, the user profile key according the user answers
	 * @param _nick_name   a String, the nickname of the user in the network.
	 * @return true if the join success, fail otherwise.
	 */
	public boolean join(String _profile_key, String _nick_name);

	/**
	 * Gets the nicknames of all automatically creates friendships.
	 * 
	 * @return a list of String.
	 */
	public List<String> getFriends();

}
```



To implement this interface, the SocialImplementation.java class has been defined, which in addition to implementing the interface methods, defines other methods that allow on the one hand, to introduce new features, and on the other to ensure and improve the functioning of the methods interface.

```java

public class SocialImplementation implements SocialInterface {

    final private Peer peer;
    final private PeerDHT _dht;
    final private int DEFAULT_MASTER_PORT = 4000;
    String myKey;
    private static int peerId;
    User _user = new User();

    /*
     * This constructor allows the creation of an object of type
     * SocialImplmentation. It needs three input parameters: peer id, reference to
     * the (known) masterpeer, and an object of type MessageListener. By exploiting
     * the knowledge of the master peer, the peer succeeds in calling the
     * bootstrap() method, necessary for the first access to a p2p network.
     */
    public SocialImplementation(int _id, String _master_peer, final MessageListener _listener) throws Exception {
        peerId = _id;
        peer = new PeerBuilder(Number160.createHash(_id)).ports(DEFAULT_MASTER_PORT + _id).start();
        _dht = new PeerBuilderDHT(peer).start();

        FutureBootstrap fb = peer.bootstrap().inetAddress(InetAddress.getByName(_master_peer))
                .ports(DEFAULT_MASTER_PORT).start();
        fb.awaitUninterruptibly();
        if (fb.isSuccess()) {
            peer.discover().peerAddress(fb.bootstrapTo().iterator().next()).start().awaitUninterruptibly();
        } else {
            throw new Exception("Error in master peer bootstrap.");
        }

        peer.objectDataReply(new ObjectDataReply() {
            public Object reply(PeerAddress sender, Object request) throws Exception {

The use of these methods is provided through a main class that allows the use of the social. 

The main class contains the MessageListenerImpl class which implements the MessageListener interface. This class needs to implement the method "parseMessage", which will be invoked whenever the peer receives a new message sent directly by other peers.

```java
 class MessageListenerImpl implements MessageListener {
            int peerid;

            public MessageListenerImpl(int peerid) {
                this.peerid = peerid;

            }

            public Object parseMessage(Object obj) {

                TextIO textIO = TextIoFactory.getTextIO();
                TextTerminal terminal = textIO.getTextTerminal();
                terminal.printf(obj + "\n");
                return "success";

            }

        }
```

Its behavior is elementary: it reports the message on the terminal. In particular, it is used to send a notification of join to the social by a peer to all peers connected at that moment.

Finally, it is possible to use some of the features implemented several times, thanks to a basic menu created ad hoc.

For each of the visible options, a series of method calls is defined that allow you to perform this operation.

Entering 1 will return a list of nicknames of peers (users) friends (friendship has been established by the social network based on interests). By entering 2 you will be able to search for a user by entering his nickname. The entry does not require you to specify upper or lower case characters but only that they are the correct characters (and sometimes numbers). By entering 3 you can re-enter some information such as name, surname and age entered during the first access. Entering 4 will leave the social network.



# 4. Test Cases

The test cases were implemented with JUnit and can be found in `test\java\it\unisa\adc\p2p\AppTest.java`

Here are the test cases of some functions implemented in the project:

- Test case di Join()

```java
 /*
     * Test case of the join () function. This function allows access to the user's
     * social network. It needs a profile key (previously generated by another
     * function) and a nickname entered by the user. Returns true if the login was
     * successful and false otherwise.

- Action that is performed before each test

```java
 @BeforeAll
    static void initPeers() throws Exception {
        /* Initialization of peers used for testing */
        peer0 = new SocialImplementation(0, "127.0.0.1", new MessageListenerImpl(0));
        peer1 = new SocialImplementation(1, "127.0.0.1", new MessageListenerImpl(1));
        peer2 = new SocialImplementation(2, "127.0.0.1", new MessageListenerImpl(2));
        peer3 = new SocialImplementation(3, "127.0.0.1", new MessageListenerImpl(3));

# 6. Docker

This is the DockerFile defined for Semantic Harmony Social Network:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine/git
WORKDIR /app
RUN git clone https://github.com/daniele321b/daniele_cioffi_adc_2020.git

FROM maven:3.5-jdk-8-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=0 /app/daniele_cioffi_adc_2020/social /app
RUN mvn package

FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app
ENV MASTERIP=127.0.0.1
ENV ID=0
COPY --from=1 /app/target/social-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar /app

CMD /usr/bin/java -jar social-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -m $MASTERIP -id $ID
```

The basic steps to run this application in a Docker container:

- clone of the repository (https://github.com/daniele321b/daniele_cioffi_adc_2020.git):

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/daniele321b/daniele_cioffi_adc_2020.git
  ```

- open a terminal e move to the folder containing the DockerFile you just downloaded:

  ```
  cd daniele_cioffi_adc_2020/social
  ```

- build the docker container:

  ```
  docker build --no-cache -t social-p2p .
  ```

- execute the master peer

  ```
  docker run -i --name MASTER-PEER -e MASTERIP="127.0.0.1" -e ID=0 social-p2p
  ```

- execute another peer (generico):

  - for this operation it is necessary to recover the actual IP address of the container on which we have previously launched the master peer. To do this:

    - verify the ID of docker container in execution:

      ```
      docker ps
      ```

    - verify the information of master peer:

      ```
      docker inspect <master peer ID>
      ```

  - At this point we can find the ip address under the heading "Ip-address" of the .json resulting from the command docker inspect.

    The command to execute is therefore the following:

```
docker run -i --name PEER-1 -e masterip="ip-container" -e ID=1 social-p2p
```

To launch other peers just execute the last block by entering a different ID at each launch.



# 7. Conclusion and future developments

The realization of this project has expanded and strengthened my theoretical and applicative knowledge regarding P2P networks. To the concepts described and demonstrated by the teacher during the course, I was able to feel the behavior of a P2P network by hand with the creation of an application.

Normally, this project can definitely be improved in all respects. In the future, new features or a GUI could be implemented that makes the application more user-friendly, abandoning the raw structure created for educational purposes.
